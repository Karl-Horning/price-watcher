# Price Watcher (Amazon)

The program gets the title and price of a product based on the URL.

The end goal is to send an email when a product matches or is lower than the price you are willing to pay.

At present, the program is being tested by running it every hour for thirty days and logging the date, time, title, and price in a CSV file.

The program can watch for price changes and include them in a CSV file.
